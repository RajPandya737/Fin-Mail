Fin-Mail is a bot that delivers timely and insightful financial updates directly to your email. Stay informed about the current state of major stocks, market trends, and investment opportunities effortlessly. This project is still under development.

## Design

Unfortunetly the full version of the bot is not available to see as it contains sensitive information about the investments we are associated with, however, this is what the PDF and Excel file looks like:

The bot does have graphing capabilities, however will not be used in the final version.
